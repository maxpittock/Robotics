# Robotics
In its current state my program includes reactional meaningful movement and attempts to solve the maze. While my code, in its current state, does not complete the maze the fundamentals it would need to do so are included and functional. This includes tracking for the colours implemented using colour ranges and masks. The use of multiple masks for each colour allowed have a different strategy for each colour (love, hate etc). My code utilises this to move to green, turn away from red tiles, chase yellow and chase blue tiles and if theres no colour code will spin the robot
